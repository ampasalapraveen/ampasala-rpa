## Blue Prism Closes Thoughtonomy Acquisition

 Blue Prism (AIM: PRSM) -RPA platform and Thoughtonomy’s award winning Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) capabilities.
 
 The acquisition bolsters Blue Prism’s position as the first choice for enterprises of all sizes looking to accelerate their automation strategy from the cloud. This integration gives enterprises a way to access and leverage fully integrated AI technologies such as computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to automate mission critical procedures from back office to front office. This will enable greater operational agility allowing customers to accelerate automation projects more easily to drive improved productivity and customer experiences, without needing to set up a dedicated infrastructure to support their program.
 
 “Thoughtonomy gives our Digital Workforce added cloud, management and deployment capabilities,” says Alastair Bathgate, Co-founder and CEO, Blue Prism. “These new capabilities will accelerate the reach and value our digital workers provide, especially on Microsoft Azure. We’re bringing Blue Prism to the world and Thoughtonomy is part of our push into mid-tier enterprises and key industry verticals.”
 
 According to Forrester Research, “business and government purchases of public cloud infrastructure, platform and application services will reach $411 billion by 2022.” Furthermore, “as cloud solutions become a larger and larger part of tech budgets and operations, CIOs will need to treat cloud as core to their technology delivery to business; not as peripheral activities that can be lightly managed.”
 
 We are delighted to see two of our strategic partners coming together. Thoughtonomy was early in its vision of delivering ‘Robots as a Service’ and we absolutely endorse the view by Forrester that corporates are genuinely shifting towards deeper cloud solutions. This is a very natural marriage and the timing feels highly appropriate and will further enhance Blue Prism’s position as a leader in intelligent Automation,” says Pascal Baker, Co-Founder & Chief Client Officer for Symphony, a SYKES company.
 
 Thoughtonomy further supports Blue Prism’s cloud strategy by giving customers an easy to manage SaaS offering running on Microsoft Azure. Customers can easily leverage ready-to use channel interfaces such as chatbots and web-forms coupled with Thoughtonomy’s integrated AI-enabled digital workforce manager, IADA®, help companies scale their automation strategy at speed.
 
 “This acquisition gives us the foundation to deliver the next generation of intelligent automation capabilities,” says Terry Walby, CEO and Founder of Thoughtonomy. “Together we immediately provide the most comprehensive portfolio in the market, but our ambitions are just taking flight. We will broaden and simplify access to the most advanced Digital Workforce on the planet. We are just getting started.”
 
 Together both companies will continue to build out the strongest partner network in the industry aimed at driving up customer adoption in key market verticals including financial services, telecom, insurance, retail, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, professional services, energy, utilities, public sector and outsourcing providers. This also includes commitments to support partner enablement, sales,
